                    <i>“If A Goal Doesn't Challenge You, It Cannot Change You.”</i> – Julius Peter Oyet

                    <p>
                        Before diving too deep into the consequences and psychological effects of not being challenged, I’d like you to think of someone you admire and ask yourself,
                        What you’ll find in answering that question is that behind every great man or woman is a series of challenges that were overcome, fears overruled, belief systems overhauled, and obstacles overrun. Many people admire me and wish to be like me but the do not want to face and overcome the challenges I did!
                        Every day presents challenges – big and small – challenges that you either rise toward or fall short of.  And while some may consider a dream job to be the one that pays you to do nothing all day and offers no stress nor expectations of performance, nothing could be further from the truth.
                        Let’s look at the consequences associated with quitting, being underemployed, and not rising to meet the demands of a challenge.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Diminished Sense of Self-Worth and Personal Value</h4>
                    </div>
                    Eventually you come to think of yourself as the kind of person who is “underserving of success”; an average Joe.  When you begin to lose faith in yourself, it leads to a downward spiral of psychological devastation that is extremely difficult to overcome.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Imprisoned By The Comfort Zone</h4>
                    </div>
                    Adapting to your comfort zone creates habits of thinking and acting that becomes dysfunctional and debilitating.  By remaining in your comfort zone, you choose to incarcerate yourself rather than liberate your talents, skills, hopes, and dreams.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Perpetuation of Pain</h4>
                    </div>
                    Avoiding a challenge only achieves self-sabotage and the perpetuation of pain, which leads to a cycle of failure and disappointment.  Failure’s high price is commonly imposed through bankruptcy, unemployment, depression, poor grades, stress, and other forms of physical and psychological pain.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Character Assassination</h4>
                    </div>
                    Fellow Ugandans, Africans and Citizens of the World, by allowing fear to control your life, you will serve as a disturbing example of wasted talent, of someone who chose fear over courage.  Your life will be viewed as the sad consequence of neglect, excuse making, self-pity, poor character, lack of direction, and a telling deficiency in courage.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Development of a Quitter Reputation</h4>
                    </div>
                    Quitting is a habit that follows the path of least resistance.  A challenge requires you to increase your level of resistance and tolerance to pain, inconvenience, and sacrifice.  Once you develop a quitter reputation, your options become limited, your reputation becomes questionable and your future is in serious jeopardy.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Little to No Impact</h4>
                    </div>
                    The ultimate test of the impact of your life is twofold: whether the world you leave behind is qualitatively better from that which you inherited, and what contribution you made to that change.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Limited Earning Ability</h4>
                    </div>
                    You negatively affect your financial opportunities by choosing fear over courage.  Fear compromises your quality of life, undermines your ability to provide for your family, and turns your golden retirement years into a time of fear, uncertainty, shame, and regret.  By not actively stretching yourself and rising to meet a challenge, you will only survive and never know what it means to enjoy safety, security, and peace of mind.
