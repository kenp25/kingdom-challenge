                <h3>Commitment to Excellence</h3>
            </div>

            <p>
                The Pursuit of Excellence is not only politically correct, it’s also highly profitable. Excellence is a
                form of currency—reputational currency. A commitment to excellence can help you capture true wealth and
                realize the inherent value of your potential, while a lack of commitment devalues potential, credibility,
                and reputation.
                Each of us must determine the specific achievements we must accomplish in order to deem our own life
                “excellent.” Your responsibilities in doing this include choosing a career path, deciding what to and
                what not to believe in, what to learn and apply in life, and what actions to take.  You can help yourself
                with these responsibilities by consistently asking one simple question: How are your thoughts and actions
                reflective of a life committed to excellence?
                So what exactly is excellence? Think of it as the process of continually growing and improving yourself
                and your life. Excellence includes achievement of goals that can be measured by constantly asking the question;

                <h4>“Is what I’m doing truly reflective of a life committed to excellence?”</h4>
                Your greatest responsibility in seeking excellence is to define what this means precisely in your life,
                then to choose the best course of action to make it happen.
                Excellence is not a relative term; It Is The Standard By Which You Must Judge What You Do. You will
                quickly discover that committing yourself to a life of excellence cannot be accomplished haphazardly.
                Excellence never occurs by accident. It always comes as the result of quality thinking and purposeful
                execution.  To become the person you were meant to be, everything you do must be done with the single
                purpose of achieving excellence. You must do it with the unshakeable belief and understanding that
                excellence counts.
                You must live and die in the spirit of quality and excellence. The measurement of your “best” begins and
                ends with the marks of excellence—nothing less. Some people perpetually create their own dissatisfaction
                by consistently slipping into mediocrity. This can easily be fixed, too, right now by simply deciding to
                quit doing less than excellent work. What a profound idea!
                Mediocrity is a choice; it’s not always made consciously, but it is still a choice. You commit career
                malpractice every time you do things in a mediocre manner; every time you show up late; every time you
                are unprepared.
                There is no inherent value in mediocrity, so there is no reason for people to stop and pay attention to
                you or your work. Choose never to compromise your talent, quality, and high standards, and you will
                never choose mediocrity.
                Being world-class has nothing to do with size, education, or bloodline; it has everything to do with
                decision, commitment, action, and persistence.
                Excellence is a destination for anyone who appreciates, respects, and demonstrates hard work and good
                judgment. But excellence is not something that you attain and then put in a trophy case. It is a habit—a
                momentary happening—a crossroad where the body, mind, and spirit all work together.  Those who have
                legitimately reached the summit of their careers, relationships, gamesmanship, have worked harder and
                longer; studied and planned more assiduously; practiced more self-denial; and overcome more difficulties
                than those who have not risen as far.
                You can become excellent in a second—beginning right now. Start by visualizing yourself as the best
                teacher, artist, manager, coach, or parent that you aspire to become—and start acting the part.
                Put yourself in the best possible position to succeed, and then perform your script exactly as it plays
                out in your mind. It takes less than a second to raise your standards higher than they are right now.
                You must merely decide to deliver world-class quality, but it takes a lifetime of passionate pursuit to
                maintain it, whether you are the concierge at a hotel, the manager of a small department, or the CEO of
                an international fi rm. One of the wonderful things about excellence is that when it is on, you’ll know
                it because you’ll enjoy the experience through all five senses:
                <h4>Look:</h4>
                Impeccable grooming, solid posture, and complete preparation for a business meeting display the look of
                excellence.
                <h4>Feel:</h4>
                An inviting smile, the fine leather of a new car, and the smooth texture of fabric demonstrate the feel
                of excellence and quality.
                <h3>Sound:</h3>
                A rich singing voice, an expansive vocabulary, and the friendliness of a wake-up call are examples of
                excellence in communication.
                <h3>Taste:</h3>
                The design of a home, the font of a letter, and the sweetness of a chef’s dessert all celebrate
                excellence in taste.
                <h3>Smell:</h3>
                The aroma of fresh flowers, the bouquet of a perfume, and the scent from freshly baked cookies help us
                to experience the smell of excellence.
                Excellence wastes little time in making its presence felt as it represents an example of truly great
                thinking. We should all appreciate the merits of rich thoughts, high personal standards, and a commitment
                to squeeze every ounce of ones potential.
                Excellence begins as a decision—one where you look at your life, business, and relationships and ask,
                “What do I see that needs improvement? What do I wish I didn’t see? What would I ideally like to see?
                What do I hear other people say about me? What do I see that rubs me the wrong way about others?”
                The answer to these questions, along with others like them, will provide the points of improvement you
                seek.
                Implementing and sustaining a drive toward excellence will put you in the best position relative to
                others for opportunity. It will also help you build support because you demonstrate real accountability,
                genuine results, and superior performance.
                Seven Guiding Principles Of Excellence
                The following are the Seven Guiding Principles of Excellence. They serve as the building blocks in
                starting and sustaining the construction of your ideal future, and serve as guideposts for success
                throughout the Kingdom Challenge.
                <ol>
                    <li>You must always live a virtuous life. It is not enough to just live; you must live with nobility and honour.</li>
                    <li>You must always act to inspire, promote, and celebrate excellence in yourself and in others.</li>
                    <li>You must always choose your actions based on good reasons and good reasoning, not out of fear, self-interest, or other short-term considerations that compromise long-term opportunities.</li>
                    <li>You must always seek out the truth and live with it, even if that truth is unpopular or uncomfortable.</li>
                    <li>You must always rely on principles that stand the test of time and changes in circumstances. The conclusions you draw from them must be ones to which you can be constantly faithful.</li>
                    <li>You must always do the right thing and never do wrong willingly, even when others have wronged you.</li>
                    <li>You must always keep your promises and honour your commitments, provided that they are just.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    By mastering one principle, one day at a time, you will build a stairway to higher and higher attainment. Your stairway will be strong because you have concentrated on one thing at a time.
                    Excellence is a guilty pleasure, as it creates confidence and enhances peace of mind. It functions as an insurance policy against mediocrity and an assurance of continuous growth. A genuine commitment to excellence allows you to bump yourself up from coach to first class anytime you wish.
                    We all have a range of career choices and opportunities, but we expand this range and quality of our choices when we practice excellence. Adversely, we blackball ourselves from future opportunities when we do mediocre work.
                    Most people are not hard acts to follow, and that’s exactly why a commitment to excellence is the ultimate competitive advantage.
                    Excellence is achieved via qualitative, not quantitative, shifts in developing skills. Be part of a qualitatively different world or environment, where excellence is expected and practice is a key to achieving excellence.
                    Never relax the rules of excellence. When you compromise quality, you suffer physical and emotional detachment from your goals. Have the belief that the efficiencies of your business and life are infinite, that everything can be improved upon, that every project can be completed in an excellent fashion.
                    Why? Because when it comes to excellence… Wisdom Is The Principle Thing!
