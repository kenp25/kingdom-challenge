        Have you secretly felt that since you have struggled too much and fail perhaps you don’t deserve to be rich and happy? That’s your upper-limit problem. The first step in fixing this is to ask why you feel that way. I thought I didn’t deserve to be rich and happy, because I was too young. I shouldn’t be so successful because I would outshine my sister and make her look or feel bad. Stop thinking that you don’t deserve success. You deserve to be rich and happy.
