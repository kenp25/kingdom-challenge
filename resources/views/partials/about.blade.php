                    From Bishop Julius Peter Oyet, The Founder of Kingdom Challenge!
                    I have no idea what you want...and have no business telling you what to want. My job is to help you get it in the fastest, most efficient manner possible. The Kingdom Challenge, a hardcore performance acceleration system will do just that. Not only will you get what you want, but you'll get it faster and with the least possible effort. Notice...I said you'll get what you want "faster" and with the "least possible effort" — I Did Not Say That It Would Be Easy.
                    Why is it called the Kingdom Challenge?
