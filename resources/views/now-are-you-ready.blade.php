By that I mean once you&rsquo;re able to rise up to meet the demands of a challenge, you&rsquo;ll be finished with self-limiting beliefs, finished with settling for less, finished with excuses, finished with playing small games, and finished with living a sedentary life. Rise up Africa and let us push until we achieve success!</p>

Amidst several challenges, I was arrested by the Uganda Military for just being an Acholi (Tribe) that was my crime! After my untold suffering in a military detention for months where I ate my own waste and drunk my urine for survival and escaping death over five times, I was transferred from Patongo (Agago District) to Lira Military prison where I became a baby sitter and a houseboy to a military officer. A found myself marrying when I was in Senior Five (S5 &ndash;Advanced Level)! After experiencing a number of sufferings, setbacks and challenges which I rose up to meet, I came to the understanding that life was NEVER meant to be simple and easy, and that the rigorous strenuous life is the one that produces the most desirable fruit.

                <p class="western" lang="en-US" align="left">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Ubuntu;">I now understand that rising to meet a challenge allows you to expand your capacity to believe in yourself. In fact, your ability to do is the only sustainable resource you have to astound yourself and show the world your greatness.</span></p>
                <p class="western" lang="en-US" align="left">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Ubuntu;">These challenges led me to create <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Kingdom Challenge</strong></span> the most powerful goal-setting programme for rising to meet any challenge, and for driving radical results &ndash; FAST!</span></p>
